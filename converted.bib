	abstract = {We use functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate short-term neural effects of a brief sensorimotor intervention adapted from the Feldenkrais method, a movement-based learning method. Twenty-one participants (10 men, 19–30 years) took part in the study. Participants were in a supine position in the scanner with extended legs while an experienced Feldenkrais practitioner used a planar board to touch and apply minimal force to different parts of the sole and toes of their left foot under two experimental conditions. In the local condition, the practitioner explored movement within foot and ankle. In the global condition, the practitioner focused on the connection and support from the foot to the rest of the body. Before (baseline) and after each intervention (post-local, post-global), we measured brain activity during intermittent pushing/releasing with the left leg and during resting state. Independent localizer tasks were used to identify regions of interest (ROI). Brain activity during left-foot pushing did not significantly differ between conditions in sensorimotor areas. Resting state activity (regional homogeneity, ReHo) increased from baseline to post-local in medial right motor cortex, and from baseline to post-global in the left supplementary/cingulate motor area. Contrasting post-global to post-local showed higher ReHo in right lateral motor cortex. ROI analyses showed significant increases in ReHo in pushing-related areas from baseline to both post-local and post-global, and this increase tended to be more pronounced post-local. The results of this exploratory study show that a short, non-intrusive sensorimotor intervention can have short-term effects on spontaneous cortical activity in functionally related brain regions. Increased resting state activity in higher-order motor areas supports the hypothesis that the global intervention engages action-related neural processes.},

	title = {Feldenkrais Method- based Exercises improve Quality of Life in Individuals with Parkinsons' Disease: a randomised controlled clinical trial},
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Longevity results in changes to patterns of health, with an increased prevalence of chronic diseases. Parkinson's disease (PD) is described as a progressive neurodegenerative disease related to age that influences quality of life (QoL) and leads to depression.  OBJECTIVE: The study intended to assess changes in QoL and depression in older adults with PD through use of Feldenkrais method-based exercise.  DESIGN: The study was a controlled, blinded, and randomized clinical trial. SETTING: The study occurred at the University Hospital of the Federal University of Sergipe in Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 30 patients, aged between 50 and 70 y, with idiopathic PD, who signed an informed consent form and were randomly assigned to 2 groups: treatment and control. INTERVENTION: The treatment group underwent 50 sessions of an exercise program based on the Feldenkrais method. The control group received educational lectures during this period. The treatment group's 50 sessions, given 2 ×/wk on alternate days and lasting 60 min, were conducted in an appropriate room at the hospital. OUTCOME MEASURES: Two surveys, the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life (PDQL) questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), were administered before and after the sessions for both groups. RESULTS: After the exercises based on the Feldenkrais method, the treated group showed improvement in QoL scores (P =.004) as well as a reduction in the level of depression (P =.05) compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: The findings in the current study indicate that it is likely that the practice of a program based on the Feldenkrais method can contribute greatly to the QoL of patients with PD, suggesting the importance of interventions that promote wellness for this population.},

	title = {The Effectiveness of the Feldenkrais Method: a Systematic Review of the Evidence},
	abstract = {The Feldenkrais Method (FM) has broad application in populations interested in improving awareness, health, and ease of function. This review aimed to update the evidence for the benefits of FM, and for which populations. A best practice systematic review protocol was devised. Included studies were appraised using the Cochrane risk of bias approach and trial findings analysed individually and collectively where possible. Twenty RCTs were included (an additional 14 to an earlier systematic review). The population, outcome, and findings were highly heterogeneous. However, meta-analyses were able to be performed with 7 studies, finding in favour of the FM for improving balance in ageing populations (e.g., timed up and go test MD −1.14 sec, 95% CI −1.78, −0.49; and functional reach test MD 6.08 cm, 95% CI 3.41, 8.74). Single studies reported significant positive effects for reduced perceived effort and increased comfort, body image perception, and dexterity. Risk of bias was high, thus tempering some results. Considered as a body of evidence, effects seem to be generic, supporting the proposal that FM works on a learning paradigm rather than disease-based mechanisms. Further research is required; however, in the meantime, clinicians and professionals may promote the use of FM in populations interested in efficient physical performance and self-efficacy.},

	abstract = {Feldenkrais and Shiatsu enable somatic learning through continuous tactile coupling, a real-time interpersonal dynamic unfolding in a safe dyadic sphere. The first part of our micro-ethnographic study draws on process vignettes and subjective theories to demonstrate how bodywork is infused with systemic sensitivities and awareness for non-linear process management. Expressed in dynamic systems parlance, both disciplines foster metastability, adaptivity, and self-organization in the client's somato-personal system by progressively reconfiguring systemic dispositions, i.e., an attractor landscape. Doing so requires a keen embodied apperception of hierarchies of somato-systemic order. Bodyworkers learn to explore these in their eigenfunction (joints, muscles, fascia), discriminate coordinative organization in small ensembles, and monitor large-scale dynamic interplay. The practitioner's “extended body” reaching forth into the client's through a resonance loop eventually becomes part of this. Within a bodywork session, practitioners modulate this hierarchical functional architecture. Their ability for sensorially staying apace of systemic emergence allows them to respond to minute changes and customize reactions in a zone of proximal development (dynamic immediacy). They stimulate the client's system with a mix of perturbing and stabilizing interventions that oscillate between eigenfunctions and their coordinative integration. Practical knowledge for “soft-assembling” non-linear synergies is crucial for this (cumulative local effects, high-level functions “slaving” the system, etc.). The paper's second part inventorizes the bodyworker's operative tool-box—micro-skills providing the wherewithal for context-intelligent intervention. Practitioners deploy “educated senses” and a repertoire of hands-on techniques (grips, stretches, etc.) against a backdrop of somatic habits (proper posture, muscle activation, gaze patterns, etc.). At this level, our study addresses a host of micro-skills through the lens of enactive cognitive science.},

	title = {Vocal Pedagogy of the Feldenkrais Method},
	abstract = {This chapter explores how a vocal pedagogy based on the development of kinaesthetic awareness and movement can enhance the learning experience of vocal students. It will examine how an approach to vocal pedagogy based on the Feldenkrais Method can lead to learning that is more deeply understood in a physical or embodied sense. In doing this, it will look at how the method is taught and how it can form a vital part of an integrated educational approach. It will also attempt to clarify the thinking behind the method and to see how it may offer insights into questions currently being asked about motor learning and its implications for vocal teaching and learning. The chapter will consider how this method may be a useful tool in support of the many different styles of vocal teaching that currently exist, from the most intuitive and traditional to the most scientifically informed. This may be due to the sensory specific nature of the learning undertaken and the context in which it can be understood. The Feldenkrais Method can be used to link traditional and scientific vocal pedagogical approaches to the sensory experiences of singers learning their craft. A basic question the Feldenkrais Method poses is: ‘How do I bring my intentions into action’? This question is essential in understanding the perspective that the method provides, and also goes a long way towards answering a question posed by Harding (2007), which asks about how we make the link between vocal technical concepts and physical coordination. Or, more specifically, can we help vocal students to place instructions received in the vocal studio into a sensory context that is meaningful for them?},

The reasons people seek Feldenkrais® lessons are poorly understood. Similarly, little is known about practice characteristics and patterns. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted an extensive survey of United States Guild Certified Feldenkrais Teachers®. Methods: We invited all Feldenkrais Teachers to participate in this survey delivered in web-based or print formats. Results: Overall response rate was 30.5% (392/1287). Ninety percent of responders had college degrees in diverse fields; 12.5% had credentials outside health care, 36.9% held conventional health care licenses, and 23.1% had complementary and alternative medicine credentials. Mean age was 55.7 years; most teachers were women (83%). California (n = 100) and New York (n = 34) had the most teachers. The primary reason students sought Feldenkrais lessons was pain. A quarter of students self-referred, a fifth were referred by conventional health care providers, and two-thirds paid for services directly. Conclusions: Most Feldenkrais Teachers were well educated, often held additional credentials, were located in the West, were women, were older than 50 years, and had part-time practices. Most students were women, were adults, came from various referral sources, and paid directly for services. Teachers and students utilized the Feldenkrais Method in diverse settings and applications. },

	abstract = {Background: Approximately 35%-40% of adults who are above 65 fall at least once in a year. The reasons for it may be declines in sensory and motor function and integration leading to poor balance and falls. Therefore, preventive measures for falls and falls-related injuries in elderly individuals are of critical importance. Therefore the purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness of two approaches such as Pilates intervention (PI) and Feldenkrais Intervention (FI) in improving functional balance and quality of life (QOL) in ambulatory geriatrics.
Material & Methodology: Total 60 Ambulatory geriatrics subjects were selected and randomly allocated into three groups (Pilates intervention-PI; Feldenkrais intervention-FI and Control).Each group had 20 subjects in it. All the groups completed 6 weeks of intervention. Functional reach test (FRT), Timed up and go test (TUG), Dynamic gait index (DGI) for functional balance and RAND-36 for Quality of life is measured at baseline and After 6 weeks of training.
Results: The 6 weeks of PI & FI protocol resulted in significant improvement of functional balance (FRT, TUG & DGI: p=0.000) and QOL (RAND-36: p=0.000) in elderly individuals which was not evident in the control group. However PI was found to be more clinically effective compared to FI in all outcome scores.
Conclusions: Both Pilates and Feldenkrais are effective in improving functional balance and decreasing propensity to fall in ambulatory geriatrics thereby improving QOL. However, Pilates Intervention was found to be superior to Feldenkrais Intervention to improve functional QOL among ambulatory geriatrics.},

However, evidence of the effectiveness of the FM among persons with COPD is lacking. Objective: To investigate the impact of the FM in patients with COPD. Methods: An observational pilot study was conducted in 11 COPD patients attending a university teaching hospital. The FM was administered for a period of 8 weeks. The 6-min walking test (6MWT) was used to measure functional capacity; forced expiratory volume in 1-s, predicted percent (FEV1 pred %) was used to evaluate lung function, and the Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire was used to measure QoL before and after the intervention. Results: Paired t-tests showed significant improvements in 6MWT from baseline to 8 weeks post-FM [P=0.01, t=−4.869, difference (Df)=10, 95% confidence interval (CI): −113.9, 42.4] with a large effect size (d=0.72).

Through examining the way in which the psychologist Ellen Langer correlates increased mindfulness with a clearer sense of the available options during decision-making, the article shows the relationship between Langer's experimental studies and the practices developed by the somatic practitioners Moshe Feldenkrais (developer of the Feldenkrais Method) and Minoru Inaba (Aikido master). In conclusion, the article suggests that somatic practices and physical training should not merely be seen as tools to improve physical technique, but as valuable processes for improving the actor's embodied sense of self during decision-making.},

	abstract = {Evidence-based practice confirms the need for outcome measures to establish the effects of health interventions. Feldenkrais Method practitioners struggle to use such tools because of the broad scope of the Feldenkrais Method and the difficulty identifying suitable measurement tools. A pre/post test design was used to investigate the use of three outcome measurement tools [Patient-specific Functional Scale (PSFS), Pain Outcome Profile (POP) and Short Form12v2 Health questionnaire (SF12v2)] for clients experiencing problems performing everyday functional tasks who attended Feldenkrais sessions. Changes were detected in the clients’ ability to perform everyday tasks (PSFS improved 3.8 points, p<0.001), levels of pain decreased (POP improved in current pain p=0.001, physical index p<0.001 and affective index p=0.001) and quality of life improved significantly in six of the eight SF12v2 domains. These three tools have been found to be suitable for detecting changes in client function before and after a series of Feldenkrais sessions. },

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effects of Feldenkrais Method balance classes on balance and mobility in older adults. Design: Prospective non-randomized controlled study with pre/post measures. Setting: General community. Participants: Convenience sample of 26 community-dwelling older adults (median age 75 years) attending Feldenkrais Method balance classes formed the Intervention group. Thirty-seven volunteers were recruited for the Control group (median age 76.5 years). Intervention: Series of Feldenkrais Method balance classes (the ‘Getting Grounded Gracefully’ series), two classes/week for 10 weeks. Main outcome measures: Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) questionnaire, Four Square Step Test (4SST), self- selected gait speed (using GAITRite™ instrumented gait mat). Results: At re-testing, the Intervention group showed significant improvement on all of the measures (ABC, p=0.016, 4SST, p=0.001, gait speed, p<0.001). The Control group improved significantly on one measure (4SST, p<0.001). Compared to the Control group, the Intervention group made a significant improvement in their ABC score (p=0.005), gait speed (p=0.017) and 4SST time (p=0.022). Conclusions: These findings suggest that Feldenkrais Method balance classes may improve mobility and balance in older adults.},

	abstract = {Background: Feldenkrais Method balance classes have been found to be effective in improving balance in recent studies, but there has been little research into possible mechanisms behind the effectiveness of these classes. Indeed, there has been little research into the content of any balance training classes. Objectives: To analyse the content of a series of Feldenkrais Method balance classes to gain an understanding of how the results in these studies may have been achieved and the principles through which the method may be effective. Design: Qualitative research approach (content analysis). Method: Feldenkrais Method Awareness Through Movement lessons were transcribed and the contents were analysed. An intercoder reliability study was undertaken. Results: The content analysis revealed that the classes used motor skill acquisition elements of internal feedback, repetition and variability of practice using an exploratory learning approach. Postural control skills of intersegmental coordination of ankle/hip/trunk synergies were practised, with control of the centre of mass over the base of support explored in anterior/posterior, medio/lateral, diagonal, rotational and circular directions. Key findings were the extensive involvement of trunk flexibility and control in the balance activities, and also the intensive attention to internal feedback which was linked to body awareness training. Conclusion: The Awareness Through Movement lessons contained many elements consistent with current theories of motor skill acquisition and postural control, providing a sound theoretical basis for the effectiveness of the Feldenkrais approach in improving balance. The methodology used in this study may provide a useful model for similar investigations into other balance training approaches.},

This concept assumes that by becoming more aware of one's movements, one functions at a higher level. In similar ways to those using the Feldenkrais method, individuals may become more aware of their own movements by performing Qi Gong exercises: A therapeutic modality that facilitates mind–body integration. Qi Gong exercises commonly lead to increased personal awareness accompained by enhanced quality, fluency and smoothness of movement. These two methods of movement therapies are explored in terms of their relations with Gestalt concept and humanistic psychology.},

	abstract = {Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a major public health concern, a financial challenge for health care providers, and critical issues for older adults. Poor balance and limited mobility are major risk factors for falls. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine effects of Feldenkrais exercises in improving balance, mobility, and balance confidence in older adults. Methods: Participants (N = 47, mean age 75.6) were randomly assigned to a Feldenkrais group (FG, n = 25) or to a control group (CG, n = 22). The FG group attended a 5-week Feldenkrais program, 60 minutes three times per week, while the CG group was a waitlist control. The outcome measures were balance (tandem stance), mobility (Timed Up and Go), gait characteristics (GAITRite Walkway System), balance confidence (Balance Confidence Scale; ABC), and fear of falling (Falls Efficacy Scale). Pre- and post-tests were conducted. Results: After completion of the program, balance (p = 0.030) and mobility (p = 0.042) increased while fear of falling (p = 0.042) decreased significantly for the FG group. No other significant changes were observed. However, participants of the FG group showed improvements in balance confidence (p = 0.054) and mobility while performing concurrently a cognitive task (p = 0.067). Conclusions: These results indicate that Feldenkrais exercises are an effective way to improve balance and mobility, and thus offer an alternative method to help offset age-related declines in mobility and reduce the risk of falling among community-dwelling older adults. A long-term follow-up study of balance and mobility is warranted. Further research is needed to identify whether Feldenkrais exercises may impact cognitive processes.},

The authors tested a method of lengthening hamstring muscles called "Awareness Through Movement" (ATM) that does not use passive stretching. SUBJECTS: Thirty-three subjects who were randomly assigned to ATM and control groups met the screening criteria and completed the intervention phase of the study. METHODS: The ATM group went through a process of learning complex active movements designed to increase length in the hamstring muscles. Hamstring muscle length was measured before and after intervention using the Active Knee Extension Test. RESULTS: The ATM group gained significantly more hamstring muscle length (+7.04 degrees ) compared with the control group (+1.15 degrees ). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:: The results suggest that muscle length can be increased through a process of active movement that does not involve stretching. Further research is needed to investigate this finding},

This patient received interventions based on Feldenkrais Method twice a week for 8 weeks. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Brain activation was studied using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). During each session, the patient performed a finger-to-thumb opposition task, which involved one bimanual and two unimanual conditions. Each condition consisted of overt movement of fingers and imagery of the same task. RESULTS: With recovery, greater recruitment was observed of the affected primary motor cortex (M1) and a decrease in activation of the unaffected M1 and supplementary motor area. In addition, the widespread activation of brain areas seen during the initial session changed to a more focused pattern of activation as the patient recovered. Imagery tasks resulted in similar brain activity as overt execution pointing to imagery as a potential tool for rehabilitation.},

Design: Review and commentary. Methods: Search of databases PubMed and EMBASE and screening of bibliographies. Published clinical studies were included if they used individual hands-on approaches and a focus on body awareness, and were not based on technical devices. Results: Of the 53 studies identified, 20 fulfilled inclusion criteria. No studies blinded subject to the treatment being given, but 5 used an alternative treatment and blinded participants to differential investigator expectations of efficacy. No study used a credible placebo intervention. No studies reported measures of patient expectations. Patient expectations have been measured in studies of other modalities but not of hands-on mind-body therapies. Options are presented for minimizing investigator and therapist bias and bias from differential patient expectations, and for maintaining some control for nonspecific treatment effects. Practical issues with recruitment and attrition resulting from volunteer bias are addressed. Conclusions: Rigorous clinical trials of hands-on complementary and alternative therapy interventions are scarce, needed, and feasible. Difficulties with blinding, placebo, and recruitment can be systematically addressed by various methods that minimize the respective biases. The methods suggested here may enhance the rigor of further explanatory trials.},

It is hypothesized that: 1) Moving is a primary mode of interacting with a world that we construct through our interactions; 2) self-moving is a way of knowing, which structures both the knowing self and the perception of personal reality; 3) self-change is a process of self-learning which changes the ways in which the self perceives and interacts with personal reality, the nature of which reality changes in a mutually causal relationship with processes of self-change. This study is a philosophical inquiry in narrative form, informed by my experience as a dancer and a practitioner of The Feldenkrais Method of Somatic Education. Dynamical Systems Theory is employed as a concept-generating metaphor, by means of which personal experience is interwoven with theoretical approaches to cognition as embodied and environmentally embedded. A conceptual structure is developed in which the cognizing self, as a dynamical system, is defined as an environmentally dependent self-organizing, complex of structural change, absent any central controller. The cognitive domain encompasses all the possible functional interactions, where function is taken to comprise moving, sensing, feeling, and thinking. The integrated nature of function stipulates that: 1) Each component of function represents and postulates the others and functions as a whole; 2) all human actions, including processes of abstract thought, are accompanied by distinct patterns of muscular activity. Thus, a change in habitual patterns of movement is reflected in a change in habitual patterns of function, and a change in any other aspect of function is reflected in changes in patterns of movement . The implications for processes of learning and change are discussed, together with potential pedagogical applications. },

	abstract = {The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasing worldwide, especially by patients with chronic diseases. To date, no data are available about utilization and perceived effectiveness of CAM in patients with dystonia. A questionnaire survey on utilization and costs of CAM was completed by 180 members of the German Dystonia Society, a patient advocate group. In total, 131 dystonia patients (73%) were current or former users of CAM, 55 patients used CAM in addition to botulinum toxin A injections, and 86 patients had experience with three or more CAM methods. The options used most widely were acupuncture (56%), relaxation techniques (44%), homeopathy (27%), and massages (26%). Among users of specific CAM methods, breathing therapy, Feldenkrais, massages, and relaxation techniques were perceived as most effective. On average, patients spent 1,513 Euro on CAM without reimbursement. There was no correlation between costs and perceived effectiveness of different methods. In line with other studies on chronically ill patients, our results show that dystonia patients frequently utilize CAM methods, often in addition to conventional treatment. There is a growing need to evaluate scientifically the effect of CAM methods on symptom severity and quality of life in dystonia, to prevent utilization of costly and ineffective CAM treatments.},

	title = {  Beginners' guide to science.},
	abstract = { The idea for this beginners guide came to my mind during a meeting in Munich, Germany, initiated and sponsored by Roger Russell, Ulla Schläfke and Prof. Klaus Schneider in July 2003, where two university professors, Beatrix Vereijken from Norway and Klaus Schneider from Germany, sat down with something like 40 Feldenkrais practitioners to collect ideas for research projects in connection with the Feldenkrais method. So we were discussing and working and everybody was very motivated, but at one point we got suddenly stuck. In this situation it occurred to me that full-time researchers don’t know how the ordinary (Feldenkrais) person thinks and the ordinary (Feldenkrais) person has no idea of the thinking of a scientist. To create a little bit more understanding for the Feldenkrais people in this project I pulled out all my notes and books from my research method classes and tried to give a little introduction to them, to facilitate the dialogue with the scientific world we are facing. Now with the IFF Academy Research Journal we again move a little bit forward on this road with collecting and presenting a lot of thoughts and studys about the Feldenkrais Method. It seems to be the right place for this beginners guide to science again, to introduce to basic concepts lying behind the studys. },

	title = { Finding our own language.},
	abstract = { The Feldenkrais Method is first and foremost an experimental practice guided by certain fundamental assumptions both explicit and implicit. These assumptions have been influenced by a variety of experiences/concepts/theories..... In “The Case of Nora – Body Awareness as Healing Therapy” Moshe Feldenkrais wrote that the working hypothesis for this case study “is somewhere between intuition and future scientific gospel.” As yet we are still far from approaching this future science, but the conditions for its emergence have improved. Such science can only be developed through dialogue. I am interested here in the number of possibilities and preconditions for such a dialogue with different sciences and what Feldenkrais teachers and scientists can learn from one another. Our practice is to some extent already interdisciplinary and many-voiced because we are always dealing with living human beings who cannot be fitted into the limitations and fragmentations of separate disciplines. Thus we need many dialog partners. We should not only favour the natural sciences. If we wish to get in a dialogue with others, we have to be able to express what is important to us in our work, what experiences we have and what insights we gain. This requires that we develop and practise using a language of our own. In December 2002 leading scientists and Feldenkrais teachers met in Paris for a dialogue.(1) In an atmosphere that was both pleasantly relaxed and stimulating, a group of Feldenkrais teachers from all over the world listened to lectures with great interest. These four days were a beginning but not as yet a proper dialogue. The lectures and conversations with colleagues prompted me to write down a few thoughts about the relationship between Feldenkrais and science. This is a personal response, founded on my individual and professional background as much as on what I experienced in Paris – and what I felt to be missing there. Others would respond differently; and thus a dialogue might ensue which could take us further. My thoughts are associative and fragmentary rather than systematic. They are intended to encourage discussion rather than trying to prove or justify something.},

	abstract = {Somatic Education is the name of a new disciplinary field which focuses on the living body, on the biological basis of consciousness and awareness, and on movement as experienced in space. The Feldenkrais Method and all other methods for somatic education share the need for qualitative research: to formulate their theories and define the scientific basis of their concepts; to measure the effects of their practices; to understand and improve the training process for practitioners and teachers. The paradoxical nature of verbally conducted research dealing with a non-verbal research object such as the body also needs to be clarified. Any researcher concerned with the quality of somatic education must bring to the research process an awareness of her/his own body.

The data of these patients were compared to those of the members of a control group, also consisting of 15 eating disordered patients who did not participate in a Feldenkrais course. The participants of the Feldenkrais-course showed increasing contentment with regard to problematic zones of their body and their own health as well as concerning acceptance and familiarity with their own body. Other results were a more spontaneous, open and self-confident behaviour, the decrease of feelings of helplessness and decrease of the wish to return to the security of the early childhood , which indicates the development of felt sense of self, self-confidence and a general process of maturation of the whole personality. The outcome points to the therapeutical effectiveness of the Feldenkrais Method with eating-disorder patients within a multimodal treatment},

	title = { Awareness Through Movement Improves Quality of Life in People with Multiple Sclerosis  },
	abstract = {PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To assess quality of life changes associated with a successful balance intervention in a group of people with MS. NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: 12 people with MS mean age 54 yrs, mean Kurtzke EDSS level 4.75 MATERIALS/METHODS: Subjects were randomly assigned to 2 groups: Awareness Through Movement intervention (ATM) and control group (EDU). The ATM group participated in 8 Awareness Through Movement sessions while the EDU group participated in 4 educational sessions over 2 months. Balance and mobility measures were performed before and after the intervention period. These results were published in Neurology Report 2001; 25(2): 39-49. To assess quality of life the MSQLI was administered before and after the intervention. The MSQLI has 10 sub-scales including: Modified Fatigue Impact (MFIS), Pain Effects, Perceived Deficits (PDQ), and Modified Social Support Survey (MSSS).All scales are valid for people with MS with reliability scores ranging from .78 to .97. Data analysis used Kruskal - Walis ANOVA for group comparisons and Spearman rs for correlations. RESULTS: There were 3 significant group differences: 1) increase in pain effects in the ATM group (p< 0.03); 2) decrease in perceived difficulty recalling recent events (PDQ-RM) in the ATM group (p< 0.035); and 3) improvement in perceived availability of others for companionship (MSSS-POS) in the ATM group (p< 0.035). Improvement on the PDQ-RM was highly correlated with decreased Fatigue Impact. Improvement in MSSS-POS was highly correlated with decrease in cognitive fatigue impact and a decrease in total PDQ, retrospective memory and planning and organization subscale scores. CONCLUSIONS: The larger picture that emerges is that an intervention that was successful in improving balance and mobility had other spin-off benefits that were physical, psychological and social improving quality of life. ATM is intended to improve people's awareness and understanding of their bodies and to help individuals create alternative strategies for setting and achieving goals in their life. This spin-off impact may be present in other kinds of interventions but it has not been measured or documented. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In an environment where patients and payers increasingly demand significant functional outcomes and measurable improvements in quality of life, it is important to document not only the physical outcomes but also the outcomes that reflect quality of life.},

Analyses of variance for repeated measures revealed mood improvement following Feldenkrais , swimming, and yoga but not following aerobic dance and computer lessons. Mindful low-exertion activities as well as aerobic activities enhanced mood in 1 single session of exercise. The authors suggest that more studies assessing the mood-enhancing benefits of mindful activities such as Feldenkrais and yoga are needed.},

A second aim was to explore the relationships between SOC, HRQL and self-efficacy and to examine whether SOC could be a predictor of the treatment outcome. METHOD: A total of 78 patients, 64 women and 14 men, were recruited consecutively to the three treatment groups. The instrument used were the Swedish version of SF-36, the 20 items Arthritis Self-efficacy Scale and the 29-item questionnaire by Antonovsky. RESULTS: The results showed that there were significant improvements on all subscales of SF-36 except for one. By using effect-size values it was found that the BAT and FK groups reached larger effect-size than did the conventional therapy group. These two groups also improved in self-efficacy of pain and stayed stable while the third group deteriorated at the one-year follow-up. There were significant correlations between the mental dimensions of SF-36 and SOC indicating that the instruments may measure aspects of the same global construct. CONCLUSIONS: Although few significant differences between the three treatment groups the BAT and FK seemed to improve health-related quality of life and self-efficacy of pain to a somewhat higher degree than the conventional physiotherapy. SOC seemed to be a stable trait measure over time.},

	abstract = {The ability of the FELDENKRAIS Method to reduce state anxiety was investigated. Specifically, both a single FELDENKRAIS Awareness Through Movement lesson and a 10-week FELDENKRAIS Awareness Through Movement programme were studied. Participants volunteered to take part in one 1-hour class each week for 10 weeks. Individuals who declined to participate in the 10-week programme were given the opportunity to participate in a single 1-hour lesson during week 5. Participants were divided into two groups: new and returning students, based on previous experience with Awareness Through Movement lessons. Participants were administered the state scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al. 1983) prior to the beginning of the first lesson (week 1--T1), immediately before and after the fifth lesson (week 5--T2 and T3), and after the final lesson (week 10--T4). Findings indicated that state anxiety scores decreased significantly over a single lesson (T2 T3) for both new (n=13) and returning (n=42) students. In addition, state anxiety scores were significantly lower after the 10-week programme (T4) when compared with baseline scores (T1) for new (n=3) and returning (n=42) students, with new students experiencing a significantly greater reduction than returning students. These findings can be interpreted as further support for the efficacy of the FELDENKRAIS Method in reducing state anxiety.},

Despite the recent increase of somatic education within dance education and academia, there has been little research investigating somatic education and contemporary dance from the perspectiva of the student. This thesis presents a phenomenological study examining student perceptions of the Feldenkrais Method ® of somatic education and contemporary dance technique with a group of pre-professional and professional dancers in New Zealand. A socio-constructivist position informs the researcher’s teaching process and the interpretation of students’ experiences. Students’ voices are examined through thematic anÃ¡lisis while the researcher’s teaching practice is investigated through teacher research (Cochran-Smith, 1993; Mitchell, 2000; Russel & Bullock, 1999) and reflective practice (Schon, 1983). Students’ perceptions of experiences over five days of classes are gathered through participant observation, group discussions, journal entries and individual interviews. Results are discussed in relation to socio- constructivist epistemology, students’ perceptions of self authority and sensory awareness in dance. The study has shown that a combination of both teacher and student centred pedagogy was a useful approach for integrating somatic education and contemporary dance technique. The outcomes of this study may contribute to knowledge in a range of areas that include research methodology in dance, research in the Feldenkrais Method ® of somatic education and research in teachers’ professional knowledge in dance education. },

	abstract = {This tutorial describes the Feldenkrais Method and points to parallels with a dynamic systems theory (DST) approach to motor behaviour. Feldenkrais is an educational system designed to use movement and perception to foster individualized improvement in function. Moshe Feldenkrais, its originator, believed his method enhanced people's ability to discover flexible and adaptable behaviour and that behaviours are self-organized. Similarly, DST explains that a human-environment system is continually adapting to changing conditions and assembling behaviours accordingly. Despite little research, Feldenkrais is being used with people of widely ranging ages and abilities in varied settings. We propose that DST provides an integrated foundation for research on the Feldenkrais Method, suggest research questions, and encourage researchers to test the fundamental tenets of Feldenkrais. },

	abstract = { This installment, the fourth in a series, presents information useful in harnessing the principles of physics to bodywork and movement therapy. It also provides encouragement towards developing skeletal awareness. This 'felt-sense' may help bind a better resolution of the spatial relationships of the human locomotor frame. In turn, this conception may assist in applying the Principle of Least Effort to good effect. Gravity, an unseen force of constant direction and intensity, may be another ally in our use of the Principle of Least Effort. An abstraction, the centre of gravity, may be useful in refining our sense of self as we orient and move through space. Leverage is the last concept presented; the fulcrum and common forms of leverage in the body are presented along with the idea of axes of rotation and instantaneous axes of rotation.},

Also introduced is the idea of reversibility; an attribute, described by Feldenkrais, indicating excellence in motor control. Different forms of gait provide a vehicle for discussion.

Participants (N = 26) were aged between 25 and 78 years, and were recruited from a community health centre, a rehabilitation hospital, and from the general community. The sample was divided into two groups: Feldenkrais and control. The Feldenkrais group experienced a 30-minute Awareness Through Movement session whilst the control group listened to a narrative of the same duration. Pain was assessed pre and post intervention using the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire. State anxiety was also measured pre and post intervention using the State Scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Multivariate Analyses of Variance showed that the Feldenkrais intervention was effective in reducing the affective dimension of pain (p < .05), but not the sensory or evaluative dimensions, nor state anxiety. These findings are discussed in relation to previous research and some of the theoretical concepts assumed to underlie the Feldenkrais Method. The clinical implication of the findings involves the potential for the Feldenkrais Method to complement existing modes of pain management for people experiencing chronic low back problems.},

The purpose of this study is to compare treatment effects of Body Awareness Therapy, Feldenkrais, and conventional individual treatment with respect to changes in psychological distress, pain, and self-image in patients with nonspecific musculoskeletal disorders. A total of 78 patients, 64 females and 14 males, with nonspecific musculoskeletal disorders were recruited consecutively to the different treatment groups in a quasi-experimental design. The patients were measured three times during the study period: before the interventions, after six months, and after one year. The results showed significant positive changes over time in all three treatment groups with regard to reduced psychological distress, pain, and improved negative self-image. There were few significant differences among the groups but effect-size analysis indicated that the group treatments using Body Awareness and Feldenkrais might be more effective than conventional treatment.},

Twelve people with multiple sclerosis were randomly assigned to either ATM or control groups. The ATM group participated in 8 classes, 2 to 4 hours each while the control group participated in educational sessions, over 10 weeks. Six outcome measures were used: the Basic Balance Master modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction in Balance (mCTSIB) and Limits of Stability tests; the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale; prospective falls; Equiscale; and the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale. The ATM group exhibited significantly improved mCTSIB scores indicating an average center of pressure position closer to theoretical center, had significantly fewer abnormal mCTSIB tests, and demonstrated improved balance confidence compared to controls. There was a trend toward improvement in all other measures in the ATM group compared to controls. These results suggest that this type of motor learning intervention can be effective in improving a variety of physical and psychological parameters related to balance and postural control.},

	title = {Bodies, meanings and movement : a comparison of the language of a physical education lesson and a Feldenkrais movement class.  },
	abstract = { In Western societies since (and probably before) Descartes, the human body has been objectified and alienated from the self, something to be subdued, managed and more recently worked upon as symbol of self-value. Sport and exercise are sites where the objectification of the body has been traditionally promoted. In recent times with the scientisation of elite sport and the commodification of bodies in sport, the objectification of the body has taken new forms and achieved greater prominence. Physical education as the school site for body work has been implicated in the process of objectification and alienation. The traditional practices of physical education, including choices in teacher language, position bodies as objects, and movement as an instrumental outcome of practice. Not all movement practices, however, subscribe to this approach. This paper will compare the language practices of teachers in a physical education lesson and a Feldenkrais movement class as these constitute different forms of embodiment, different selves. Its purpose is to provide further resources for critical reflection on the ways in which pedagogical practices position students and contribute to the shaping of particular forms of subjectivity.},

This issue features additional clinical examples and an explanation of several terms of art in bodywork: stress, strain, translation and rotation. These words help to stake out the territory of bodywork. There are only five forms of strain and only two basic movement s in any form of bodywork. We shall see the practical advantages of understanding the concepts these words carry. Clinical results may be enhanced with improved physical safety to both the therapist and client. Secondly, a sure grasp of the technical meanings of these words is essential for delving further into the treatment applications of the Principle of Least Effort.},

Analysis of variance showed that anxiety scores for all groups varied significantly over time and, specifically, that participants reported lower scores at the completion of the fourth intervention. Further, compared to the control group, females in the FELDENKRAIS and relaxation groups reported significantly lower anxiety scores on completion of the fourth session (compared to immediately prior to the fourth session), and this reduction was maintained one day later.

Conventional intensive chronic pain treatment programs costs range from $7,000 to $30,000 and are not covered by regular Medicaid benefits. Patients with chronic headaches and/or musculoskeletal problems were enrolled in the study. Seven patients began the program; all completed it. Patient satisfaction, function, and perception of pain were evaluated by using the National Pain Data Batik (NPDB) protocol of the American Academy of Pain Management. Participants reported more mobility and decreased perception of pain, both immediately after the program and in a one-year follow-up questionnaire. Results compared quite favorable with NPDB comparison groups. Cost effectiveness calculations were based on Medicaid costs for one-year periods pre- and post-intervention. Patient costs dropped from an average of $141 per month to $82 per month. This represents a 40% savings},

	abstract = {Although the Feldenkrais Method is rapidly gaining popularity among health professionals, only a small body of empirical research has documented its efficacy. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of the Feldenkrais Method on flexibility, perceived exertion and hamstring length. In Study 1, 79 healthy participants undertook measurements of flexibility (sit and reach test), perceived exertion (Borg's Rating of Perceived Exertion 6-20) and hamstring length (active knee extension test) prior to being randomly allocated into a Feldenkrais or control group. The same measurements were taken after the group intervention (a Feldenkrais Awareness Through Movement lesson, or control procedure). Although the Feldenkrais participants improved significantly more in sit and reach measurements than their control counterparts, no differences between the groups were found for measures of perceived exertion or hamstring length. In Study 2, a subsample of 39 participants took part in a further three intervention sessions with the three measures being taken again prior to and after the fourth (final) intervention. No group differences were found for any of the outcome indicators across time. These findings are discussed in terms of implications for further research and health care practice.},

Observation of our experience indicates that we are actually consciousing, and that experiencing is closely related to movement and the muscular sense. The position of this paper is that mind and body are not two entities related to each other but an inseparable whole while functioning. From concrete examples from the Feldenkrais Method, it is shown that changes in the organization of movement and functioning are intimately related and that one cannot change without conscious experience. Implications for the resolution of controversies in the field of consciousness studies and the neurosciences are suggested.},

The Portland State University Posture Analysis Form (PSU PAF), a force platform, and a tape measure were used to measure postural alignment, postural sway, and height before and after treatment sessions. Subjects completed a subjective questionnaire. Controls rested in supine posture during the treatment session, while the exercise group performed selected Feldenkrais and psychophysical re-education exercises. Dependent t-tests were used to determine differences between the pre tests and post tests. Both groups showed decreases in all sway variables, for both eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) conditions, improved alignment of body parts, and increased height. Only the exercise groups showed statistically significant sways. Only exercise group subjects reported feeling more efficient after the treatment session. Both groups reported increased tightness and discomfort of various body parts after treatment. The data suggest that the supine positioning is responsible for some changes. The postural sway results and the rate of height increase suggest that the exercises may also have independent effects.},

Assessment before and after the series of classes included the Incapacity Status and the Environmental Status Scales of the Minimal Record of Disability, the Fatigue Severity Scale, and the Index of Well-Being. Before each class and at the final data collection, each person was asked several questions about her medical and functional status. Analyses of walking and supine-to-stand were done using the PEAK Motus video motion analysis system. A follow-up interview was done with two women one year after the classes ended. Three of the four participants experienced an increase in symptoms at some time during the 10 weeks; nonetheless, all made improvements. Outcomes show that two broad areas of improvement were ease and steadiness of daily movement s, and sense of well-being. These Outcomes suggest that Awareness Through Movement is beneficial for some people with multiple sclerosis, although in different ways for each person.},

Four subjects were chosen to participate in this study based on their initial score on a semantic differentiation scale. The four subjects met with the researcher twice a week for 45 minutes each time to receive either tutoring or Awareness Through Movement lessons. Subject one received Awareness Through Movement lessons during the whole six weeks session. Subject two received Awareness Through Movement lessons for the first three weeks and one-on-one tutoring during the last three weeks. Subject three received one-on-one tutoring the first three weeks and Awareness Through Movement lessons during the last three weeks. Subject four received one-on-one tutoring during the whole six weeks session. The subjects completed a semantic differentiation scale before the study began, after three weeks, and at the end of the study. The results indicated that a person who received Awareness Through Movement lessons scored higher on a semantic differentiation scale designed to measure body image, than a person who received one-on-one tutoring. The results also indicated that although the score on the semantic differentiation scale decreased slightly three weeks after the person stopped the Awareness Through Movement lessons, the score did not revert back to the initial level. This study suggests improvements in body image as measured on the semantic differentiation scale, following ATM lessons, compared to controls receiving tutoring. Four subjects, crossover design.},

The current study investigated the effects of the Feldenkrais method on hamstring length. Forty-eight healthy undergraduate participants were randomly allocated into Feldenkrais, relaxation, or control groups. All subjects had their right hamstring measured using a modified active knee extension test prior to the first session, prior to the fourth (final) session, and after the final session of intervention. Two-way analysis of variance with time of measurement repeated revealed no significant differences between the groups. The findings are discussed in relation to apparent ineffectiveness of the Feldenkrais awareness through movement lessons used on hamstring length, exposure time to the technique, and attitudes towards the Feldenkrais method.},

	abstract = { This article contains a listing of many unpublished pieces of research, which are not listed in other places. Peer Reviewed. Musculoskeletal disorders are often suggested to be caused, in part, by poor postural behaviors that are associated with occupational demands. The inefficacy of conventional strategies to elicit postural correction has prompted many to seek alternative techniques such as the Feldenkrais Method[R]. The rapidly growing use of the Feldenkrais Method[R] by laypersons and professionals has been fueled by extravagant claims and data published in non-peer-reviewed sources, for the effectiveness of this technique has been poorly documented in peer-reviewed publications. Therefore the purpose of this review was to critically assess the literature on the Feldenkrais Method[R] in both juried and non-juried sources. The results have generally indicated some improvement with Feldenkrais[R] interventions, however, these improvements are not nearly as large as suggested by the anecdotal claims. Unfortunately, most of the juried and non-juried findings and conclusions are questionable due to inadequately controlled studies and other serious methodological problems. As such, determination of the effectiveness of the Feldenkrais Method[R] based on the literature is difficult at best, and the only justifiable conclusion is that more study is warranted.},

This balance is central to the theories of somatic education, such as those developed by Alexander, Rolf, and Feldenkrais. Accordingly, this paper argues that the use of somatic education in stuttering treatment may promote the perception of relaxation and facilitate the habituation of new behavior patterns, thereby leading to improved generalization of relaxation outside the treatment setting. },

The data of these patients were compared to those of the members of a control group, also consisting of 15 eating disordered patients who did not participate in a Feldenkrais course. The participants of the Feldenkrais-course showed increasing contentment with regard to problematic zones of their body and their own health as well as concerning acceptance and familiarity with their own body. Other results were a more spontaneous, open and self-confident behaviour, the decrease of feelings of helplessness and decrease of the wish to return to the security of the early childhood, which indicates the development of felt sense of self, self-confidence and a general process of maturation of the whole personality. The outcome points to the therapeutical effectiveness of the Feldenkrais Method with eating-disorder patients within a multimodal treatment program.},

	abstract = {These included (among others) conscious breathing, walking meditations, Authentic Movement, Body-Mind Centering, Feldenkrais Awareness through Movement, yoga related to chakras, and theatre improvisational games. Concurrently, the course encouraged participants to become consciously aware of their creative processes. The researcher utilized data from pre and post questionnaires, written responses regarding exercises, essays regarding creativity, autobiographical essays, and exit interviews. Data were presented via individual profiles of the participants, mostly in their own words, structured around these questions: (1) How do students understand their own creative process? (2) How do they experience creative blocks? (3) What were the effects of this course? (4) What connection, if any, do participants perceive between body awareness and creativity? and (5) Does being a member of a group that comes together to focus on somatics and creativity affect one's creative life? The researcher found participants shared many common themes concerning their experiences of (a) creativity, (b) somatics, and (c) the relationship of somatics to creative process. Themes of self-knowledge, movement from inside to outside, power, energy, receptivity, heightened states of awareness, and change were the most prevalent, dynamic ways in which participants experienced the three categories to be related. The researcher concluded that somatic awareness seemed to be a means of enhancing and fostering creativity for the participants of this study, and that courses which value creativity and kinesthetic "ways of knowing" would be valuable in general college curricula as well as in arts curricula. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to investigate how, if at all, participants, in a specially designed course, experience and understand the relationship between somatic awareness and their creative processes, and (2) to ascertain the value and effectiveness of this course, which emphasizes creative and somatic awareness processes and seeks to provide an atmosphere conducive to enhancing and fostering creativity. The researcher/teacher designed and implemented, at a university, a semester-long course and research project, in which seven women participated. The women, ages 20-51, were encouraged to do a daily practice of exercises designed to increase conscious awareness of sensations in their bodies. http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations/AAI9638966/},

@article{211,
	title = { Training the whole person. },
	abstract = {Advocates a holistic approach to employee training programs that makes the object of attention the complete activity rather than an isolated piece. The core assumption underlying this approach is that competent performance requires the involvement of the whole person in the whole task. Conventional instruction teaches pieces of a task but may fail to integrate those pieces into an overall pattern. With the holistic approach the student works with patterns of activity that take him/her closer to the activity being trained. Applications of this approach to the training of operators, salesmen, and technicians are considered, and a revolutionary system of psychophysical education developed by M. Feldenkrais (1972, 1982) is described that posits that all human actions involve the entire brain-body system and depend on an internal mental model of self-image. Poor performance results from an incomplete or incorrect self-image. Holistic methods of training encourage greater attention to the process of performing an activity than to the end goal. Paradoxically, as the process is performed more efficiently the goal is achieved more easily--even as it receives less conscious attention. },

In all cases, the experimental groups proved significantly superior to the control groups.
